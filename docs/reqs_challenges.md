## Challenges
**Music Translation**: It was difficult to find songs that sounded good with only one note playing at a time. Also, transcribing the music was a challenge for someone who has little musical experience. 
**Harmony**: The time committment to solve the parallel thread playing option was greater than I was willing to invest.
